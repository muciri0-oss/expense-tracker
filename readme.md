# Expense Tracker
A multi-page Expense Tracker web application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
This project was developed as a Final Independent Project and demonstrates DOM manipulation, localStorage usage, and dynamic UI rendering.

##  Features
- Add new expenses
- Delete expenses
- Automatic total calculation
- Category-based breakdown
- Reports summary page
- KES currency formatting
- Persistent data using localStorage
- Clean, modern UI design

## Technologies Used
- HTML5
- CSS3
- JavaScript (Vanilla JS)
- Browser localStorage API

## Project Structure
- `index.html` – Dashboard (All expenses + total)
- `add.html` – Add new expense form
- `reports.html` – Reports & analytics summary
- `style.css` – Application styling
- `proj.js` – Application logic

## Data Storage
All expenses are stored locally in the browser using localStorage.  
No backend or database is required.

##  How It Works
1. User adds an expense from the Add page.
2. Data is saved to localStorage.
3. Dashboard dynamically displays expenses.
4. Reports page calculates totals and category breakdown automatically.
